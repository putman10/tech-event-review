# Tech Event Review
*Optional Independent Javascript Project Writeup*

1. **What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?** **Junior Developer Happy Hour** on Wednesday, August 15, 2018
5:30 PM to 7:30 PM at White Owl Social Club 1305 Se 8th Ave https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/246615957/
2. **Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?** **Portland JR DEVELOPER Meetup Group!** There was originally a guest speaker https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/gbpffpyxnbwb/ but that portion of the event was cancelled.
3. **What was the format of the event?** The format was a general happy hour where there was a designated space in the outdoor section of White Owl Social Club to mingle and connect with other JR developers in the Portland area.
4. **What was the topic or main focus of the event?** The main focus was to get junior developers in the Portland area together to create parrellel connections and be able to chat about how other people are either training to become junior developers or are already developers in the field currently.
5. **What made you want to attend this particular event?** There was a large group of people attending from Epicodus so I thought it would be a good opportunity to attend a meetup where I felt comfortable showing up with someone else while still having lots of opportunity to branch out and meet new contacts. 
6. **What was the highlight of the event?** The highlight was chatting with people outside of Epicodus. Even though I had the urge to chat with Epicodus students I already knew I really pushed myself to make new connections. I reconnected with one Junior Developer that I was partnered with at the Saturday Epicodus workshop I attended before applying or deciding to go to Epicodus 6 months ago. She attended PDX Code Guild instead of Epicodus so she is already complete with her training. The format of providing post program job search help is different at PDX Code Guild (they don't provide any). Hearing what she is currently going through solidified my choice in attending Epicodus as I thought (and still thing) it is the right fit for me.
7. **What did you learn from this experience?** That although some Jr developers attended traditional colleges obtaining CS degrees, some are self taught, some attended Epicodus or similar programs we are all in the same job search situation. We all have different experience and the thing that really sets us apart is skills outside of programming. Soft skills, creativity, personal skills, ability to work independently and in groups. Epicodus seems to balance the scales and provide knowledge obtainable from a traditional college and the lack of interaction and pair programming you would experience with self teaching to provide all around balanced Jr Devs.
8. **If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)** The usual organizer of the event **Kelly** was not in attendance. In her absence she sent her friend and Epicodus alumni **Emily** to take her place. Luckily with such a big showing of Epicodus students all sitting together already we already had a large section of the patio to ourselves. If we had not shown up early there most likely would not have been a section we could designate specifically for the event. Emily had a sign and other stuff but since she showed up late is was risky to host an event like that at such a busy location. I think it would be beneficial if she could have done a brief introduction or spoken about the group and what events would be coming up in the future. Again... the normal organizer was not there so I'm sure things are better organized.
9. **Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?** I would recommend the event for people looking to make contacts at similar levels. There were some people there that worked in the field but for the most part it was other students. If it wasnt for Epicodus and having such a strong network of developer students I think it would have been more beneficial. Therefore i would recommend to anyone looking to go into development instead of people at schools like Epicodus. I was asked questions about Epicodus and my background by individuals considering a switch so I was happy to provide knowledge and relay my experience so far.
10. **Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.** The event really solidified my belief that Epicodus was a wise career choice and the perfect fit for me.
