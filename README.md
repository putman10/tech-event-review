####Optional Independent Javascript Project Writeup

1. **What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?** **Junior Developer Happy Hour** on Wednesday, August 15, 2018
5:30 PM to 7:30 PM at White Owl Social Club 1305 Se 8th Ave https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/246615957/
2. **Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?** **Portland JR DEVELOPER Meetup Group!** There was originally a guest speaker https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/gbpffpyxnbwb/ but that portion of the event was cancelled.
3. **What was the format of the event?** The format was a general happy hour where there was a designated space in the outdoor section of White Owl Social Club.
4. **What was the topic or main focus of the event?** The main focus was to get junior developers in the Portland area together to create parrellel connections and be able to chat about how other people are either training to become junior developers or are already developers in the field currently.
5. **What made you want to attend this particular event?** There was a large group of people attending from Epicodus so I thought it would be a good opportunity to attend a meetup where I felt comfortable showing up with someone else while still 
6. **What was the highlight of the event?** The highlight was chatting with people outside of Epicodus. Even though I had the urge to chat with Epicodus students I already knew I really pushed myself to make new connections. I reconnected with one Junior Developer that I was partnered with at the Saturday Epicodus workshop I attended before applying or deciding to go to Epicodus 6 months ago. She attended PDX Code Guild instead of Epicodus so she is already complete with her training. The format of providing post program completion is different though. Hearing what she is currently going through solidified my choice in attending Epicodus as I thought it was the right fit for me.
7. **What did you learn from this experience?**
8. **If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)**
9. **Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?**
10. **Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.**
