# Tech Event Review
###Optional Independent Javascript Project Writeup

1. **What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?** **Junior Developer Happy Hour** on Wednesday, August 15, 2018
5:30 PM to 7:30 PM at White Owl Social Club 1305 Se 8th Ave https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/246615957/
2. **Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?** **Portland JR DEVELOPER Meetup Group!** There was originally a guest speaker https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/gbpffpyxnbwb/ but that portion of the event was cancelled.
3. **What was the format of the event?** The format was a general happy hour where there was a designated space in the outdoor section of White Owl Social Club to mingle and connect with other JR developers in the Portland area.
4. **What was the topic or main focus of the event?** The main focus was to get junior developers in the Portland area together to create parrellel connections and be able to chat about how other people are either training to become junior developers or are already developers in the field currently.
5. **What made you want to attend this particular event?** There was a large group of people attending from Epicodus so I thought it would be a good opportunity to attend a meetup where I felt comfortable showing up with someone else while still having lots of opportunity to branch out and meet new contacts. 
6. **What was the highlight of the event?** The highlight was chatting with people outside of Epicodus. Even though I had the urge to chat with Epicodus students I already knew I really pushed myself to make new connections. I reconnected with one Junior Developer that I was partnered with at the Saturday Epicodus workshop I attended before applying or deciding to go to Epicodus 6 months ago. She attended PDX Code Guild instead of Epicodus so she is already complete with her training. The format of providing post program job search help is different at PDX Code Guild (they don't provide any). Hearing what she is currently going through solidified my choice in attending Epicodus as I thought (and still thing) it is the right fit for me.
7. **What did you learn from this experience?** That although some Jr developers attended traditional colleges obtaining CS degrees, some are self taught, some attended Epicodus or similar programs we are all in the same job search situation. We all have different experience and the thing that really sets us apart is skills outside of programming. Soft skills, creativity, personal skills, ability to work independently and in groups. Epicodus seems to balance the scales and provide knowledge obtainable from a traditional college and the lack of interaction and pair programming you would experience with self teaching to provide all around balanced Jr Devs.
8. **If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)** The usual organizer of the event **Kelly** was not in attendance. In her absence she sent her friend and Epicodus alumni **Emily** to take her place. Luckily with such a big showing of Epicodus students all sitting together we already had a large 
9. **Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?**
10. **Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.**
